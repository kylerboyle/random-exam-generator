General Usage Notes
-------------------

- This program will print hardcoded questions and answers and will prompt for user input after each
  question. Multiple choice questions should be answered by typing in the corresponding letter and
  short answer questions should be answered accordingly.

- The program has hard coded partial credit for the question called 'Question 1'.

- It is possible to redefine a new ExamTester class with a different main function in order
  to run other unit tests.


To Run the Program
------------------

- To run the program, ensure the makefile and all .java files are available in
  the directory. Type 'make' and the program will compile the ExamTester.java class
  that contains the main function. By typing 'java ExamTester' you will run the program.

Extra Methods
-------------

- The program has a couple extra functions to convert between chars and ints. They will not affect
  the user in any way.
